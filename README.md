# TCP socket 

Code to play und get familiar with networking in Python.
I'm aware there are more efficient ways. But clarity, demonstration and easy understanding is the focus of this code.

If you have any suggestions or questions feel free contact me.

It is not yet tested on a local network or over the internet.
